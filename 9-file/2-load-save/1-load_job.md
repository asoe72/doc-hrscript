# 9.2.1 load_job

Statement that reads changes of the MAIN module's project/jobs/ folder to update the memory.


### Description

Load the jobs in the project/jobs/ folder of the MAIN module into new memory.

If you copy or overwrite .job files into the jobs/ folder with FTP or copyfile commands, you must perform this statement to reflect the memory to be able to select or call the job.

- CAUTION: Jobs in memory that do not exist in the jobs/ folder will be deleted.
- If the file has different modified time, it is loaded.
- Files that do not exist in memory are loaded.

- Since large capacity .jobs can be loaded, it is performed asynchronously in the background to avoid loss of tact time due to load. The successful completion of the load can be determined by reading the value of the resulting-variable.
- You cannot request another loading until current loading is finished.


### Syntax

```python
load_job <result-variable>,"*"
```
