# 3.7.3 jump

### Description

This format is completely identical to that of call statements, and its action is also similar to that of **call** statements.

The only difference is that, while a **call** statement returns to the main program using an end program, a **jump** statement does not.

### Syntax

```python
jump <job number or file name> [,parameter 1,parameter 2,???]
```



### Example

If the jump statement of this example program is replaced with a **call** statement, the result of the replaced program will be as follows. When the **end** of the sub-program \(0102\_err\) is encountered, the action cycle will end. If the next action cycle is executed, the main program \(0001\) will be executed from the start.


```python
# 0001_main.job
print "main job start"
jump 102_err
print "main job end"
end
```

```python
# 0102_err.job
print "sub-program"
end
```

RESULT
```python
main job start
sub-program
```
