# 3.7.1 call

### Description

There is no significant difference in format between the main program and the subprogram in HRScript. The first job executed by the start button or by a signal is the main program, and all other jobs called by the **call** statement are subprograms. 

### Syntax

```python
call <job number, file name, or user function name> [,parameter 1,parameter 2,...]
```

Specify the job number of the job file name \(excluding the extension\) after the **call** statement. Then, while program A is being executed, if call B is encountered, A's execution will be stopped, and the first statement of program B, a subprogram, will continue to be executed. If the **end** or **return** statement is encountered while B is being executed, program A's execution will continue upon returning to the position of the next statement of program A's **call** statement that was previously called.

### Example

The following shows an example and the result of a subprogram called by a **call** statement. It seems meaningless to divide the program into two because the subprogram must handle only one print statement. However, a more practical example will be shown later.

* Refer to [3.7.3 def](./3-def.md) for an example of calling user function.

```python
# 0001_main.job
print "main job start"
call 102_err
print "main job end"
end
```

```python
# 0102_err.job
print "sub-program"
end
```

RESULT
```python
main job start
sub-program
main job end
```
