# 2.3.2 Assignment Statements

An assignment statement consists of the left side, the assignment operator \(=\), and the right side. The left side \(lvalue\) must be a variable that can store a value. No constants or expressions are allowed. 

On the other hand, constants, variables, and expressions are allowed on the right side \(rvalue\).
