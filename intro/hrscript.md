# 1.1 Introduction of HRScript

Hyundai Robotics’ Hi6 Controller allows the user to program the robot’s tasks in a robot language called HRScript. Created programs can be saved as several files with the extension .job.

HRScript is a scripting language that will be interpreted and executed line by line by the interpreter without a compilation procedure. It is similar to the Python or JavaScript languages but has a simpler syntax.
