# 2.4 First Program - Hello, World!

Let us create a simple job program that prints a string on the teach pendant screen. After creating a new job, record the print statement as shown below, and attach the string parameter "Hello, World!"

```python
print "Hello, World !"
```

The print statement is used to print the value at the bottom of the teach pendant's job panel. Now, when you run the program, you can see the text, "Hello, World!" printed at the bottom of the job panel.
