# 2.3.3 Comment Statements

A comment statement is used to describe the contents of the job program in a way that they can be understood easily. Even if the comment statement is executed, no operation is performed. As shown below, a description is attached after the hash sign \(\#\). It can be used as a single statement or attached after another statement.

```python
# robot has to wait sensor2 input
var work_w,work_h  # width and height of a workpiece
```
