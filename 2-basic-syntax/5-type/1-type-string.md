# 2.5.1 String Data Type

The first program in the previous paragraph used the data “Hello, World!” as the print statement’s parameter, a string data type. The value of the string data type begins and ends with double quotes. There is no limit for the length of the string.

```python
print "Welcome to the Robot World."
```

A sequence beginning with a backslash \(\\) represents double quotes or special characters in a string. This sequence is called the “escape character.”

The supported escape characters are shown in the table below.



|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| \" | Double quotes |
| \\ | Backslash |
| \t | Tab |
| \n | New line character |

```python
print "Message:\nPlease, press \"OK\" button."

# Result of print
Message:
Please, press "OK" button.
```
